# Ada Constraint_Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Ada: the `Constraint_Error` that occurs when attempting to access an array element using an index outside the array's declared bounds.

The `bug.ada` file contains Ada code that attempts to access an array element beyond its defined range. The `bugSolution.ada` file shows how to properly handle this situation using exception handling to prevent program crashes.

This example is useful for illustrating the importance of robust error handling in Ada applications.
